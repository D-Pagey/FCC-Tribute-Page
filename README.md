## Tribute Page -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the first project in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum as well as my first 
ever Front End project. I have rebuilt it many times to learn different things 
and now it's time to retire the project for good. 

**User Stories:**

further information on the topic.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
