This is my first Front End project. I originally did it using Bootstrap without fully understanding how Bootstrap worked (I still don't). I have now redone this project by getting rid of Bootstrap and coding it all in native CSS as well as making it mobile responsive with media queries.

You can see a demo of this [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GmOYdm) project on CodePen.
