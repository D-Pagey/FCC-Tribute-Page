This was my 1st Front End project and one I use to learn new technologies. The most recent version was written in React using Create-React-App, and in the past I have used this project to learn: Bootstrap, Flexbox, and SCSS.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element. It works in the vanilla JS version but not in the React version. 

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GmOYdm) project on CodePen.
