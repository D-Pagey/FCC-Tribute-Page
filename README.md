## Tribute Page -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

In this project I simply used Bootstrap, hence why there is no real styling. It's a very basic page however, for my 1st project, I think it served it's purpose well.

You can see this [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/GmOYdm) on CodePen.
